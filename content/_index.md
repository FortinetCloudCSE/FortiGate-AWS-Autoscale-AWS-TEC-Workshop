# Deploying FortiGate Autoscale Templates in AWS (latest build: 11)

## Welcome!

AWS Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is elastic, complex, and quite different from traditional on-premise networking. In this workshop you will learn how to deploy FortiGate Firewalls in an elastic autoscale group to protect your AWS workloads deployed in common architecture patterns.

This workshop is intended to help accomplish the following:

  * Learn common AWS networking concepts such as routing traffic in and out of VPCs for various traffic flows
  * Use AWS Cloudshell and Terraform to deploy a Fortigate autoscale group in a usable demo environment
  * Interact with a FortiGate autoscale group build security policy sets, and deploy them
  * Test traffic flows in an example environment and use a FortiGate autoscale group to control traffic flows
  * Configure FortiManager to manage FortiGate CNF instances
  * Configure FortiAnalyzer to collect and analyze logs from a FortiGate autoscale group
  * Learn how to use a FortiGate autoscale group to protect AWS workloads in common architecture patterns
  * Configure SDN Connectors to integrate a FortiGate autoscale group with VPC Tagged objects and dynamic policy creation
  * Deploy a FortiGate autoscale group into an existing customer environment. This is different from deploying a FortiGate autoscale group in a demo environment, as it requires the use of existing AWS resources and VPCs. This would be a common use case for a customer who wants to protect their existing AWS workloads with FortiGate autoscale group.
